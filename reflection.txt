Using branches in git allows programmers to contribute their own changes to a project without interfering with other changes that another programmer may have. If every programmer went and made changes to the main branch at the same time, they all will encounter conflicts which can be complicated to fix when done this way. With branches, each programmer can make their own changes without having to worry about conflicts until it's time to merge to the main branch.
